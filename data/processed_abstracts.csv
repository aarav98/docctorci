Abstract Background
Most patients (pts) with r/r FL remain incurable and eventual ly relapse or progress. Previously, a Ph1 study of relma-cel
(NCT03344367) had demonstrated preliminary safety and ef/f_ic acy in r/r B-NHL pts, including those with r/r FL. A Ph2 piv-
otal study in r/r FL pts had been enrolled and preliminary ef/f_i cacy, safety and PK was presented.
Methods

Background: Epigenetic alterations are major drivers of Follicular lymphoma (FL). Histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have potential to counteract the loss of histone acetylation thatresults from CREBBP orEP300 mutations. Abexinostat (Abx) is a novel potent oral pan-HDAC
inhibitor with a pharmacokinetic profile that allows maintenance of sufficient drug concen-trations for anti-tumor activity with twice daily (BID) dosing. Abx was shown to be well-tolerated with significant response in pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) FL. Methods: This
phase Ⅱstudy evaluated Abx 80 mg administered orally BID 4 hours apart in a “one week on, one
week off ”schedule (days 1 to 7 & 15 to 21 of a 28-day cycle) in pts with R/R FL (grade 1-3a). Key
inclusion criteria included age $18 years, $2 prior treatment regimens, ECOG of 0-2, and
measurable disease per Lugano 2014 criteria. Pts undergo efficacy assessment by enhanced CT/MRI every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter, and PET-CT at weeks 12and 24 and to confirm a complete response (CR), in accordance with the Lugano 2014 criteria.Bone marrow (BM) evaluation was mandated in pts with baseline BM involvement whoachieved radiographic CR. The primary endpoint is independent review committee (IRC)-assessed overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints include duration of response(DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: At the data
cut-off date of December 15, 2023, data were available for 90 pts. Median age was 55.0 (range
27-79), 57.8% of pts were male, and 22.2% had $3 FLIPI-2. Pts had a median of 3 prior lines of
therapy (range 2-9), and 24.4% were refractory to the last prior regimen, 27.8% of pts had beentreated with PI3K inhibitors before. With a median follow-up of 20.8 months, of 82 ptsevaluable for efficacy, the IRC-assessed ORR was 67.1% (95% CI: 55.8%-77.1%), including12.2% CR. The ORR for pts with .3 lines of prior therapy was 69.0% (95% CI: 49.2%-84.7%).
The median PFS and median DoR was 13.77 (95% CI: 9.69-not evaluable [NE]) months and 13.96(95% CI: 8.34-NE) months, respectively. Median OS was not reached, and the 42-month OS rate
was 74.3% (95% CI: 58.1%-85.0%). Of 90 pts evaluable for safety, the most common ( $40%)
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were thrombocytopenia (85.6%), neutropenia(58.9%), leukopenia (52.2%), nausea (50.0%), anemia (48.9%) and diarrhea (46.7%); $grade 3
TEAEs ( $5%) included thrombocytopenia (37.8%), neutropenia (23.3%), leukopenia (7.8%),
and lymphopenia (5.6%). TEAEs led to dose reductions and discontinuations in 28.9% and 3.3%of all pts, respectively. Conclusions: Abx was well tolerated at dose of 80 mg BID as mono-
therapy, and demonstrated a significant response in pts with heavily pretreated R/R FL. Clinicaltrial information: NCT03934567. Research Sponsor: None.HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES —LYMPHOMA AND CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA

Background: TQ-B3525 is a novel and selective oral PI3K a/dinhibitor. In an earlier Phase I trial,
TQ-B3525 achieved outstanding efficacy in subjects with refractory/relapsed follicular lym-phoma (R/R FL) (2020 ASCO Abstract #8058). Here, we report the result from a single-arm,open-label, phase II registration study evaluating the safety and efficacy of TQ-B3525 in R/R FL
patients. Methods: This phase II study included exploratory stage 1 and confirmatory stage 2.
Patients with R/R FL after $2 lines therapies received oral 20 mg TQ-B3525 once daily in a 28-
day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Primary endpoint was independentreview committee (IRC)-assessed objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints wereORR by investigator assessment; the IRC- and investigator-assessed disease control rate(DCR), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival(PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: Based on results (ORR, 88.0%; DOR,
11.8 months; PFS, 12.0 months) in 25 patients at stage 1, second stage study was initiated
and included 82 patients for efficacy/safety analysis.Patients received a median of 3 prior lines,
with 56.1% refractory to previous therapies; 73.2% experienced POD24 at baseline. At stage 2,ORR was 86.6% (71/82; 95% CI, 77.3%-93.1%), with 28 (34.2%) complete responses. Seven(8.5%) had stable disease for DCR of 95.1%. Median TTR was 1.8 months. Among 71 responders,median DOR was not reached; 18-month DOR rate was 51.6%. At median follow-up of13.3 months, median PFS was 18.5 (95% CI, 10.2-not estimable) months; estimated 24-month OS rate was 86.1%. Response rates and survival data were consistent across all sub-groups. Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 63 (76.8%) patients,
with neutrophil count decreased (22.0%), hyperglycemia (19.5%), and diarrhea (13.4%) being
common. Conclusions: TQ-B3525 exhibited favorable efficacy and manageable safety profiles,
supporting its potential as a valuable treatment modality for heavily pretreated Chinese R/R/ FLpatients. Clinical trial information: NCT04324879.

Background: Odronextamab, an off-the-shelf, CD20 3CD3 bispecific antibody, has shown
compelling efficacy and generally manageable safety as monotherapy in patients with heavily
pretreated relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL), including those withrituximab-refractory disease (Villasboas et al. ASH 2023). In the Phase 2 ELM-2 study,odronextamab demonstrated objective and complete response (CR) rates of 80% and 73%,respectively, and median duration of response of 22.6 months; median overall survival was notreached. Treatment-related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 7.8% of pa-tients. These encouraging results support an investigation into whether odronextamab pluschemotherapy is superior to the current FL first-line standard of care of rituximab plus
chemotherapy. This study will also evaluate whether odronextamab maintenance is required
to achieve progression-free survival (PFS), given the risks associated with sustained B-celldepletion. Methods: OLYMPIA-2 (NCT06097364) is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, mul-
ticenter study of odronextamab plus chemotherapy (Odro-CHOP/Odro-CVP) versus R-CHOP/R-CVP in patients with previously untreated FL. The study consists of Part 1A (dose escalation),Part 1B (dose optimization), and Part 2 (randomization). In Part 1, patients will receive six 21-day cycles (induction) of Odro-CHOP, in which intravenous odronextamab will be administeredin a step-up regimen starting on Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 8 to mitigate the risk of cytokine release
syndrome, followed by full dose starting from C2D8. Patients with CR or partial response at the
end of induction will receive 12 doses of odronextamab maintenance given Q8W. In Part 2,patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive induction of 6 cycles of Odro-CHOP/Odro-CVP withno maintenance (Arm A), Odro-CHOP/Odro-CVP followed by odronextamab maintenance (ArmB), or R-CHOP/R-CVP followed by rituximab maintenance (Arm C). Key inclusion criteria:aged $18 years; CD20+ FL Grade 1 –3a, stage II bulky or stage III/IV; measurable disease; and
ECOG performance status 0 –2. Part 1: patients with FL that is R/R (Part 1A only) or previously
untreated with Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-1 (FLIPI-1) score 3 –5.
Part 2: previously untreated patients with FLIPI-1 score 0 –5. Patients with central nervous
system lymphoma or histological Grade 3b are excluded. The Part 2 primary endpoint is CR rateat 30 months (CR30) by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include PFS,event-free survival, investigator-assessed CR30, and patient-reported outcomes. Biomarkers(including minimal residual disease by ctDNA) will be evaluated as exploratory endpoints. Thistrial is currently recruiting and is expected to enroll up to 64 patients in Part 1 and ~669 patientsin Part 2 at ~200 global sites. Clinical trial information: NCT06097364.

Abstract Background: Mosunetuzumab (Mosun) is a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispeci ﬁc monoclonal antibody (Bi-mAb)
that redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells. Mosun is the ﬁrst Bi-mAb approved for the treatment of patients (pts) with
relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL; EMA 2022) and is a ﬁxed-duration treatment that can be administered in an
outpatient setting. In a Phase II study (NCT02500407), Mosun demonstrated a high rate of complete response (CR) with a
manageable safety pro ﬁle in pts with R/R FL who had received ≥2 prior therapies (Budde et al. Lancet Oncol 2022). Here, we
present updated data for this cohort after a median follow-up of 27 months.Methods: Pts with FL grade (gr) 1-3a, who had received ≥2 prior therapies (including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylator)
were enrolled. Intravenous Mosun was administered in 21-day cycles with step-up dosing in Cycle (C) 1 (Day [D] 1, 1mg; C1D8,2mg; C1D15/C2D1, 60mg; C3D1 and onwards, 30mg). Pts achieving a CR by C8 completed treatment without additional
cycles; those with a partial response or stable disease received a further nine cycles (17 total). Hospitalization following
infusion was not required. The primary endpoint was CR rate determined by an Independent Review Committee. Post-hocanalyses were performed to compare ef ﬁcacy outcomes with Mosun vs last prior therapy, and assess the correlation between
cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and tumor response.Results: Ninety pts with R/R FL and ≥2 prior therapies were enrolled. Median age was 60 years (range: 29-90), and 77% of pts
had stage III/IV disease. Median number of prior lines of therapy was three (range: 2-10); 53% of pts were double refractory to
prior anti-CD20 therapy and alkylator therapy; and 52% of pts had progressive disease within 24 months from the start of their
ﬁrst-line therapy. As of May 20, 2022, median time on study was 26.7 months (range: 2.0-36.2); 54 pts (60%) had completed
© 2022 by The American Society of Hematology 15 NOVEMBER 2022 |VOLUME 140, NUMBER Supplement 1 1467initial treatment and 36 pts (40%) had discontinued initial treatment (25 pts [28%] due to progressive disease). Two pts (2%)
were undergoing retreatment, 72 pts (80%) were in follow-up, and 16 pts (18%) had discontinued the study.
In all 90 pts, investigator (INV)-assessed objective response rate (ORR) and CR rate were 77.8% (95% CI: 67.8-85.9) and 60.0%(95% CI: 49.1-70.2), respectively. Median duration of response (DOR) and duration of CR (DOCR) were not reached (NR); 79.5%of complete responders remained in remission for at least 24 months based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Median progression-
free survival (PFS) per INV assessment was NR; 24-month PFS was 51.4% (95% CI: 39.4-63.3). The ef ﬁcacy of Mosun was
compared with that of pts' last prior therapy: most pts (63%) received chemoimmunotherapy as their last prior therapy, and
the remainder received PI3K inhibitor-containing regimens (8%), anti-CD20 antibodies plus lenalidomide (2%), CAR-T therapy
(2%), or other therapies. Response rates, PFS, DOR, DOCR and time to next therapy or death were all improved with Mosun
compared with last prior therapy ( Table; Figure ).
No new CRS events, or fatal, serious, or gr ≥3 adverse events (AEs) were reported since the previous analysis, and no evidence
of chronic toxicity was observed. Overall, the rate of AEs leading to discontinuation was low (4.4%) and no treatment-relatedgr 5 AEs were observed. CRS events (44.4% of pts) were mostly con ﬁned to C1 (84.5% of events) and 97.2% were gr 1/2 in
severity; all CRS events resolved. No correlation was observed between the occurrence of CRS and tumor response. ORR was77.5% and 78.0%, respectively, in pts with or without CRS events.
Conclusions: In this updated analysis, with a median follow-up of 27 months, durable responses continued to be observed
with Mosun in pts with R/R FL. Compared with pts' last prior therapy, Mosun demonstrated higher ORR and CR rates, with
longer DOR, DOCR, PFS and time to next therapy, although limitations should be noted for retrospective comparisons and
the absence of standardized imaging assessment for the last prior therapy. The safety proﬁ le, characterized by a low rate of
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and predominantly low-grade CRS events, was consistent with previous reports and
supports the administration of Mosun as an outpatient regimen. Clinical response was observed regardless of occurrence of
CRS, suggesting the Mosun dose and schedule used is effective at dissociating cytokine toxicity from treatment ef ﬁcacy.

Yang_2024.pdf,"Myeloma using statistical methods but also allowed us to predict new patients with
missing data. This model was built and tuned using data from multiple myeloma
patients from a public database from a study conducted in Arkansas.
Results: The results of the Bayesian model allowed us to estimate the survival of
patients with missing information. Additionally, when compared with the classic
Cox models in patients with complete data, the performance metrics did not
deteriorate (concordance index of 72% and 71% respectively) in patients withcomplete data. In addition, it allows for estimating survival and staging the risk of
patients with multiple myeloma with missing data, maintaining the concordance
rate at 71%.
Conclusions: A model that performs as well as Cox models in patients with complete
data and maintains this performance in patients with missing data is achieved. It also
allows the prediction of new patients who are diagnosed with multiple myeloma
without the restriction that their complete clinical or genetic data is needed.

Background: Amulirafusp alfa (IMM0306) is a fusion protein of CD20 monoclonal
antibody with the CD47 binding domain of SIRP aon both heavy chains. It exerts
excellent cancer killing effect by activating both macrophages and natural killer cells
via blockade of CD47-SIRP ainteraction and Fc ɣR engagement. Here, we report the
safety and ef ﬁcacy results in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory follicular
lymphoma (R/R FL) from a phase II study (NCT05805943).
Methods: Eligible patients with FL Grade 1-3a received intravenous Amulirafusp alfa
once a week of a 28-day treatment cycle with dose of 2.0 mg/kg until disease pro-
gression or intolerable toxicity. Safety was evaluated per the Common TerminologyCriteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Tumor assessments were performed by
Lugano 2014. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary
endpoints including disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), and
safety.
Results: As of Mar 14, 2024, 16 pts with FL were enrolled. The median age was 61
years old with 10 (62.5%) males. The median prior lines of therapy were 4. All 16 pts
received previous anti-CD20 therapy. The most common treatment related adverse
events (TRAEs) were lymphocyte (LYM) decreased (68.8%), platelet (PLT) decreased(50.0%), white blood cell (WBC) decreased (43.8%), anemia (43.8%) and absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) decreased (31.3%). /C21Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 62.5% of pts.
The most common /C21grade 3 TRAEs were LYM decreased (50.0%), PLT decreased
(18.8%), ANC decreased (18.8%) and pneumonia (18.8%). 18.8% of pts experienced
serious TRAEs, all was pneumonia, in which 2 pts were recovering and 1 pts recoveredwithout sequelae. No adverse event led to drug reduction, discontinuation or death.
Among 15 ef ﬁcacy evaluable pts with R/R FL, the ORR and DCR assessed by inves-
tigator was 33.3% and 66.7%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 5.72 months,
the PFS rate at 9 months was 58.3%.
Conclusions: Amulirafusp alfa (IMM0306) was well-tolerated and presented robust
preliminary anti-tumor activity in pts with R/R FL. This phase II study is ongoing.

Background: Targeted therapy with Bruton ’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis)
become the standard of care for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Orelabrutinib (O)
is a novel BTKi with high selectivity and a favorable safety pro ﬁle. Despite substantial
bene ﬁts in CLL with O, real-world data remains scarce. This study aimed to evaluate
the ef ﬁcacy of O-based regimens for CLL with comorbidities in a real-world setting.
Methods: Data were retrospectively reviewed for 15 pts with CLL who underwent O-
based regimens from Jun. 10, 2022, to Sep. 10, 2023. The outcome was the hema-
tologic response (HR) rate, de ﬁned as the proportion of pts with abnormal baseline
hematologic parameters who had a hemoglobin (Hb) response, platelet (Plt)response, or lymphocyte (Lym) response (Hb/Plt/Lym count return to or reduce
>50% from baseline).
Results: Baseline characteristics of the pts are presented in the table. The median
duration of O therapy was 10.7 months (interquartile range [IQR], 8.6-14.9). At the
data cut-off (Apr. 26, 2024; median follow-up, 12.7 months), 14 (93.3%) pts achieved
an HR. The remaining 1 pt that did not reach HR was a third-line treatment pt with
HBV infection, and there was some recovery of hematologic indexes. Regarding
different O-based regimens, HR was achieved in 100% (8/8) of pts receiving O
monotherapy and 85.7% (6/7) receiving O + chemotherapy. No serious adverse events
occurred in the pts with comorbidities.

Background: Epcor is the only SC CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody approved for R/R DLBCL. In
initial protocols, hospitalization after the 1stfull dose of epcor was required to monitor patients
(pts) for and characterize CRS. The EPCORE NHL-6 trial assessed whether R/R DLBCL/FL ptstreated with SC epcor across US community and academic sites could be safely monitored in theoutpt setting. Methods: Eligible pts had R/R DLBCL or FL and at least 2 prior lines of therapy.
Epcor was given in 28-d cycles [C]; C1 SUD: 0.16 mg then 0.8 mg, followed by 48 mg; C1 –3: QW;
C4–9: Q2W; C $10: Q4W. Pts received safety education, including early identification and
reporting of symptoms of CRS and ICANS, and were required to stay #30 min of the site of
care for 24 h after the 1
stfull dose. Based on C1 optimization (OPT) findings from EPCORE NHL-1
(Vose ASH 2023, Abs 1729), the trial was amended to implement C1 OPT with hydration and
dexamethasone after enrollment of 34 pts. Results: At data cutoff, 36 pts (23 DLBCL, 13 FL)
received $1 dose of epcor (median cycles, 3). 13 and 23 pts were from US academic and
community sites, respectively. Median age was 65 y, 67% of pts had extranodal disease, and39% had prior CAR T. Any grade CRS occurred in 47% of pts and were mostly low grade (G1, n=9;G2, n=7; G3, n=1). Median time to onset of CRS after 1
stfull dose was 23 h. No CRS events led to
discontinuation; 11 pts (31%) were treated with tocilizumab, 8 (22%) with corticosteroids, and 5(14%) with both. ICANS occurred in 8% (all G1-2) with a median time to onset of 20 days from
C1D1, and all resolved. Of 31 pts receiving the 1
stfull dose, 3 pts (10%) received epcor in the
inpatient (inpt) setting while admitted for AEs other than CRS (pain management, leg injury,UTI, n=1 each). The remaining 28 pts (90%) received epcor and were monitored in the outptsetting. 12 total pts had 13 CRS events after the 1
stfull dose with CRS starting in the outpt setting
in 10 pts (G1, n=6; G2, n=4). 7/28 (25%) pts initially monitored as outpts were subsequentlymanaged as inpt for CRS. All 12 pts had resolution of CRS with a median time to resolution of 45h.Conclusions: Pts with R/R DLBCL and FL were successfully treated with SC epcor and
monitored in the outpt setting across different types of sites. CRS events occurring in the
outpt setting were appropriately managed, and the observed CRS incidence and severity was
comparable to that of the pivotal EPCORE NHL-1 trial. These data suggest that SC epcor can besafely administered and pts monitored outpt, and then managed inpt as needed for CRS.Enrollment is ongoing, and a larger dataset with C1 OPT including hydration and dexameth-asone, which are anticipated to further lower CRS incidence and severity, will be presented later.Clinical trial information: NCT05451810.

were refractory to prior CD20 and alkylating therapy (double refractory). A total of 19 (36%) pts in the mono cohorts and 10
(53%) pts in the combo cohort had experienced POD24.
In the mono cohorts, overall response rate (ORR) was 81% (n =43) and complete metabolic response rate (CMR) was 70%
(n=37), with 72% (n =21) CMR in the 0.5/2.5/10/30mg cohort and 67% CMR in both the 2.5/ 10/16mg (n =2) and 2.5/10/30mg
(n=14) cohorts. In the combo cohort, ORR was 100% (n =19) and CMR was 73.7% (n =14).
Inthemonocohorts87%(32/37)ptswereinCMR,whileinthecomb ocohort71%(10/14)ptswereinCMR.Medianfollow-up
of CMR ranged from 0-14 months (mono) and 0-5 months (combo), and at this cut-off the follow-up is insuf/f_icient to assess
CMR duration. High CMR rates were observed in high-risk pts ( Table).
The most common adverse event (AE) was cytokine release syndr ome (CRS): 66% and 79% in the mono and combo cohorts,
respectively. CRS rates by mono cohort were as follows: 2.5/1 0/16mg cohort, 100% (3/3); 2.5/10/30mg cohort, 76% (16/21);
0.5/2.5/10/30mgcohort,55%(16/29).Withmono,CRSevents(Lee etal.ASTCT2019)weremostlyGr1(47.2%)and2(17.0%);

CRS events in the combo cohort and no Gr 4 or 5 CRS with either re gimen. Of pts with CRS, tocilizumab was used to treat
CRS in 22.9% pts in mono cohorts and 33.3% pts in the combo cohort . All CRS events were manageable and had resolved
at data cut-off. Neurologic AEs were seen in 26 pts (16 mono, 10 combo; 36%); all Gr 1 (n =17) or Gr 2 (n =9). No ICANS-like

Abstract Type: Oral Presentation
Session Title: Follicular and mantle cell lymphoma - Role of bispecifics
Background:
Epcoritamab, a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody, led to deep, durable responses in patients 
(
pts
)
 with multiply
R/R FL 
(
overall response rate [ORR] 82%, complete response [CR] rate 63% per independent review
)
 in the
pivotal cohort of EPCORE
™
 NHL
​
1 
(
phase 1/2; NCT03625037
)
. Safety was manageable; most CRS events were
low grade 
(
G; 66% overall; 40% G1, 25% G2, 2% G3
)
, all resolved, and none led to treatment 
(
tx
)
discontinuation. Further mitigation of CRS and ICANS may increase epcoritamab accessibility and reduce
healthcare resource use. Enhanced CRS mitigation strategies and omission of mandatory hospitalization for
CRS monitoring are being investigated in a C1 OPT cohort.
Aims:
To report the largest population of patients 
(
pts
)
 with R/R FL receiving epcoritamab to date, with efficacy
(
including minimal residual disease [MRD]
)
 from the EPCORE NHL
​
1 FL pivotal and C1 OPT cohorts and safety
from the fully enrolled C1 OPT cohort.
Methods:
In the C1 OPT cohort, pts with CD20+ R/R FL G1
–
3A and 
≥
2 prior lines of systemic tx received subcutaneous
epcoritamab in 28-d Cs, including a third step
​
up dose in C1 
(
D1, 0.16 mg; D8, 0.8 mg; D15, 3 mg
)
, followed by
48-mg full doses 
(
QW, C1
–
3; Q2W, C4
–
9; Q4W, C
≥
10
)
 until disease progression. In C1, adequate hydration and
dexamethasone 
(
preferred steroid for mandatory CRS prophylaxis
)
 were recommended. Hospitalization for CRS
monitoring was not mandated. Primary endpoints were rates of any-grade and G
≥
2 CRS events. Secondary
endpoints included response 
(
Lugano
)
, MRD in peripheral blood 
(
clonoSEQ® assay; 10
−

)
, and
safety/tolerability. A pooled analysis of response per investigator and MRD negativity was conducted.
Results:
As of the data cutoff 
(
Jan 8, 2024; median follow-up, 5.7 mo
)
, 86 pts with R/R FL had received epcoritamab in
this C1 OPT cohort 
(
median of 2 prior tx lines [range, 2
–
9], 92% stage III
–
IV FL, 63% double-refractory disease,
44% primary refractory disease, and 42% POD24
)
. All CRS events were low grade 
(
49% overall; 40% G1, 9% G2
)
,
most occurred during C1, and none led to tx discontinuation. Corresponding with reduced CRS rate and
severity with C1 OPT, IL
​
6 levels 24 h after the first full dose were lower with C1 OPT vs the pivotal cohort. No
ICANS or clinical tumor lysis syndrome occurred. Most pts in C1 OPT who received the first full dose 
(
44/82;
54%
)
 were monitored for CRS as outpatients. Of the 38 pts who were hospitalized, 18 were hospitalized to
monitor for potential CRS and 20 were hospitalized for logistical/social reasons or other AEs. Among the 214
pts in the pivotal and C1 OPT cohorts, which had similar demographics and disease characteristics, ORR was
84% and CR rate was 65% 
(
Figure
)
. In each cohort, median times to response and CR were 1.4 mo and 1.5 mo,
respectively. CR was associated with improved progression-free survival 
(
PFS
)
. Among MRD-evaluable pts in
both cohorts 
(
n=135
)
, MRD negativity was observed in 89 pts 
(
66%
)
, and MRD negativity overall and at C3D1
(
prespecified time point
)
 were associated with improved PFS 
(
Figure
)
. Additional data, including subgroup
analyses, will be presented.
Summary/Conclusion:Epcoritamab monotherapy showed early, deep responses in the largest R/R FL population treated with a
T
​
cell
−
engaging therapy to date. CR and MRD negativity, including at C3D1, were associated with improved
PFS. Safety was manageable in both cohorts, and CRS rate and severity were substantially reduced with C1
OPT, with few G2 and no G
≥
3 events. The data suggest that mandatory hospitalization for CRS monitoring is
not necessary and support further evaluation of outpatient epcoritamab tx for pts with R/R FL.

Background: Epigenetic alterations are major drivers of Follicular lymphoma (FL). Histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have potential to counteract the loss of histone acetylation thatresults from CREBBP orEP300 mutations. Abexinostat (Abx) is a novel potent oral pan-HDAC
inhibitor with a pharmacokinetic profile that allows maintenance of sufficient drug concen-trations for anti-tumor activity with twice daily (BID) dosing. Abx was shown to be well-tolerated with significant response in pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) FL. Methods: This
phase Ⅱstudy evaluated Abx 80 mg administered orally BID 4 hours apart in a “one week on, one
week off ”schedule (days 1 to 7 & 15 to 21 of a 28-day cycle) in pts with R/R FL (grade 1-3a). Key
inclusion criteria included age $18 years, $2 prior treatment regimens, ECOG of 0-2, and
measurable disease per Lugano 2014 criteria. Pts undergo efficacy assessment by enhanced CT/MRI every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter, and PET-CT at weeks 12and 24 and to confirm a complete response (CR), in accordance with the Lugano 2014 criteria.Bone marrow (BM) evaluation was mandated in pts with baseline BM involvement whoachieved radiographic CR. The primary endpoint is independent review committee (IRC)-assessed overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints include duration of response(DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: At the data
cut-off date of December 15, 2023, data were available for 90 pts. Median age was 55.0 (range
27-79), 57.8% of pts were male, and 22.2% had $3 FLIPI-2. Pts had a median of 3 prior lines of
therapy (range 2-9), and 24.4% were refractory to the last prior regimen, 27.8% of pts had beentreated with PI3K inhibitors before. With a median follow-up of 20.8 months, of 82 ptsevaluable for efficacy, the IRC-assessed ORR was 67.1% (95% CI: 55.8%-77.1%), including12.2% CR. The ORR for pts with .3 lines of prior therapy was 69.0% (95% CI: 49.2%-84.7%).
The median PFS and median DoR was 13.77 (95% CI: 9.69-not evaluable [NE]) months and 13.96(95% CI: 8.34-NE) months, respectively. Median OS was not reached, and the 42-month OS rate
was 74.3% (95% CI: 58.1%-85.0%). Of 90 pts evaluable for safety, the most common ( $40%)
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were thrombocytopenia (85.6%), neutropenia(58.9%), leukopenia (52.2%), nausea (50.0%), anemia (48.9%) and diarrhea (46.7%); $grade 3
TEAEs ( $5%) included thrombocytopenia (37.8%), neutropenia (23.3%), leukopenia (7.8%),
and lymphopenia (5.6%). TEAEs led to dose reductions and discontinuations in 28.9% and 3.3%of all pts, respectively. Conclusions: Abx was well tolerated at dose of 80 mg BID as mono-
therapy, and demonstrated a significant response in pts with heavily pretreated R/R FL. Clinicaltrial information: NCT03934567. Research Sponsor: None.HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES —LYMPHOMA AND CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA

Background: Odronextamab, an off-the-shelf, CD20 3CD3 bispecific antibody, has shown
compelling efficacy and generally manageable safety as monotherapy in patients with heavily
pretreated relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL), including those withrituximab-refractory disease (Villasboas et al. ASH 2023). In the Phase 2 ELM-2 study,odronextamab demonstrated objective and complete response (CR) rates of 80% and 73%,respectively, and median duration of response of 22.6 months; median overall survival was notreached. Treatment-related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 7.8% of pa-tients. These encouraging results support an investigation into whether odronextamab pluschemotherapy is superior to the current FL first-line standard of care of rituximab plus
chemotherapy. This study will also evaluate whether odronextamab maintenance is required
to achieve progression-free survival (PFS), given the risks associated with sustained B-celldepletion. Methods: OLYMPIA-2 (NCT06097364) is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, mul-
ticenter study of odronextamab plus chemotherapy (Odro-CHOP/Odro-CVP) versus R-CHOP/R-CVP in patients with previously untreated FL. The study consists of Part 1A (dose escalation),Part 1B (dose optimization), and Part 2 (randomization). In Part 1, patients will receive six 21-day cycles (induction) of Odro-CHOP, in which intravenous odronextamab will be administeredin a step-up regimen starting on Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 8 to mitigate the risk of cytokine release
syndrome, followed by full dose starting from C2D8. Patients with CR or partial response at the
end of induction will receive 12 doses of odronextamab maintenance given Q8W. In Part 2,patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive induction of 6 cycles of Odro-CHOP/Odro-CVP withno maintenance (Arm A), Odro-CHOP/Odro-CVP followed by odronextamab maintenance (ArmB), or R-CHOP/R-CVP followed by rituximab maintenance (Arm C). Key inclusion criteria:aged $18 years; CD20+ FL Grade 1 –3a, stage II bulky or stage III/IV; measurable disease; and
ECOG performance status 0 –2. Part 1: patients with FL that is R/R (Part 1A only) or previously
untreated with Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-1 (FLIPI-1) score 3 –5.
Part 2: previously untreated patients with FLIPI-1 score 0 –5. Patients with central nervous
system lymphoma or histological Grade 3b are excluded. The Part 2 primary endpoint is CR rateat 30 months (CR30) by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include PFS,event-free survival, investigator-assessed CR30, and patient-reported outcomes.

Abstract Background: Mosunetuzumab (Mosun) is a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispeci ﬁc monoclonal antibody (Bi-mAb)
that redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells. Mosun is the ﬁrst Bi-mAb approved for the treatment of patients (pts) with
relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL; EMA 2022) and is a ﬁxed-duration treatment that can be administered in an
outpatient setting. In a Phase II study (NCT02500407), Mosun demonstrated a high rate of complete response (CR) with a
manageable safety pro ﬁle in pts with R/R FL who had received ≥2 prior therapies (Budde et al. Lancet Oncol 2022). Here, we
present updated data for this cohort after a median follow-up of 27 months.Methods: Pts with FL grade (gr) 1-3a, who had received ≥2 prior therapies (including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylator)
were enrolled. Intravenous Mosun was administered in 21-day cycles with step-up dosing in Cycle (C) 1 (Day [D] 1, 1mg; C1D8,2mg; C1D15/C2D1, 60mg; C3D1 and onwards, 30mg). Pts achieving a CR by C8 completed treatment without additional
cycles; those with a partial response or stable disease received a further nine cycles (17 total). Hospitalization following
infusion was not required. The primary endpoint was CR rate determined by an Independent Review Committee. Post-hocanalyses were performed to compare ef ﬁcacy outcomes with Mosun vs last prior therapy, and assess the correlation between
cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and tumor response.Results: Ninety pts with R/R FL and ≥2 prior therapies were enrolled. Median age was 60 years (range: 29-90), and 77% of pts
had stage III/IV disease. Median number of prior lines of therapy was three (range: 2-10); 53% of pts were double refractory to
prior anti-CD20 therapy and alkylator therapy; and 52% of pts had progressive disease within 24 months from the start of their
ﬁrst-line therapy. As of May 20, 2022, median time on study was 26.7 months (range: 2.0-36.2); 54 pts (60%) had completed
© 2022 by The American Society of Hematology 15 NOVEMBER 2022 |VOLUME 140, NUMBER Supplement 1 1467initial treatment and 36 pts (40%) had discontinued initial treatment (25 pts [28%] due to progressive disease). Two pts (2%)
were undergoing retreatment, 72 pts (80%) were in follow-up, and 16 pts (18%) had discontinued the study.
In all 90 pts, investigator (INV)-assessed objective response rate (ORR) and CR rate were 77.8% (95% CI: 67.8-85.9) and 60.0%(95% CI: 49.1-70.2), respectively. Median duration of response (DOR) and duration of CR (DOCR) were not reached (NR); 79.5%of complete responders remained in remission for at least 24 months based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Median progression-
free survival (PFS) per INV assessment was NR; 24-month PFS was 51.4% (95% CI: 39.4-63.3). The ef ﬁcacy of Mosun was
compared with that of pts' last prior therapy: most pts (63%) received chemoimmunotherapy as their last prior therapy, and
the remainder received PI3K inhibitor-containing regimens (8%), anti-CD20 antibodies plus lenalidomide (2%), CAR-T therapy
(2%), or other therapies. Response rates, PFS, DOR, DOCR and time to next therapy or death were all improved with Mosun
compared with last prior therapy ( Table; Figure ).
No new CRS events, or fatal, serious, or gr ≥3 adverse events (AEs) were reported since the previous analysis, and no evidence
of chronic toxicity was observed. Overall, the rate of AEs leading to discontinuation was low (4.4%) and no treatment-relatedgr 5 AEs were observed. CRS events (44.4% of pts) were mostly con ﬁned to C1 (84.5% of events) and 97.2% were gr 1/2 in
severity; all CRS events resolved. No correlation was observed between the occurrence of CRS and tumor response. ORR was77.5% and 78.0%, respectively, in pts with or without CRS events.
Conclusions: In this updated analysis, with a median follow-up of 27 months, durable responses continued to be observed
with Mosun in pts with R/R FL. Compared with pts' last prior therapy, Mosun demonstrated higher ORR and CR rates, with
longer DOR, DOCR, PFS and time to next therapy, although limitations should be noted for retrospective comparisons and
the absence of standardized imaging assessment for the last prior therapy. The safety proﬁ le, characterized by a low rate of
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and predominantly low-grade CRS events, was consistent with previous reports and
supports the administration of Mosun as an outpatient regimen. Clinical response was observed regardless of occurrence of
CRS, suggesting the Mosun dose and schedule used is effective at dissociating cytokine toxicity from treatment ef ﬁcacy.

Background: Epcor is the only SC CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody approved for R/R DLBCL. In
initial protocols, hospitalization after the 1stfull dose of epcor was required to monitor patients
(pts) for and characterize CRS. The EPCORE NHL-6 trial assessed whether R/R DLBCL/FL ptstreated with SC epcor across US community and academic sites could be safely monitored in theoutpt setting. Methods: Eligible pts had R/R DLBCL or FL and at least 2 prior lines of therapy.
Epcor was given in 28-d cycles [C]; C1 SUD: 0.16 mg then 0.8 mg, followed by 48 mg; C1 –3: QW;
C4–9: Q2W; C $10: Q4W. Pts received safety education, including early identification and
reporting of symptoms of CRS and ICANS, and were required to stay #30 min of the site of
care for 24 h after the 1
stfull dose. Based on C1 optimization (OPT) findings from EPCORE NHL-1
(Vose ASH 2023, Abs 1729), the trial was amended to implement C1 OPT with hydration and
dexamethasone after enrollment of 34 pts. Results: At data cutoff, 36 pts (23 DLBCL, 13 FL)
received $1 dose of epcor (median cycles, 3). 13 and 23 pts were from US academic and
community sites, respectively. Median age was 65 y, 67% of pts had extranodal disease, and39% had prior CAR T. Any grade CRS occurred in 47% of pts and were mostly low grade (G1, n=9;G2, n=7; G3, n=1). Median time to onset of CRS after 1
stfull dose was 23 h. No CRS events led to
discontinuation; 11 pts (31%) were treated with tocilizumab, 8 (22%) with corticosteroids, and 5(14%) with both. ICANS occurred in 8% (all G1-2) with a median time to onset of 20 days from
C1D1, and all resolved. Of 31 pts receiving the 1
stfull dose, 3 pts (10%) received epcor in the
inpatient (inpt) setting while admitted for AEs other than CRS (pain management, leg injury,UTI, n=1 each). The remaining 28 pts (90%) received epcor and were monitored in the outptsetting. 12 total pts had 13 CRS events after the 1
stfull dose with CRS starting in the outpt setting
in 10 pts (G1, n=6; G2, n=4). 7/28 (25%) pts initially monitored as outpts were subsequentlymanaged as inpt for CRS. All 12 pts had resolution of CRS with a median time to resolution of 45h.Conclusions: Pts with R/R DLBCL and FL were successfully treated with SC epcor and
monitored in the outpt setting across different types of sites. CRS events occurring in the
outpt setting were appropriately managed, and the observed CRS incidence and severity was
comparable to that of the pivotal EPCORE NHL-1 trial. These data suggest that SC epcor can besafely administered and pts monitored outpt, and then managed inpt as needed for CRS.Enrollment is ongoing, and a larger dataset with C1 OPT including hydration and dexameth-asone, which are anticipated to further lower CRS incidence and severity, will be presented later.Clinical trial information: NCT05451810.

were refractory to prior CD20 and alkylating therapy (double refractory). A total of 19 (36%) pts in the mono cohorts and 10
(53%) pts in the combo cohort had experienced POD24.
In the mono cohorts, overall response rate (ORR) was 81% (n =43) and complete metabolic response rate (CMR) was 70%
(n=37), with 72% (n =21) CMR in the 0.5/2.5/10/30mg cohort and 67% CMR in both the 2.5/ 10/16mg (n =2) and 2.5/10/30mg
(n=14) cohorts. In the combo cohort, ORR was 100% (n =19) and CMR was 73.7% (n =14).

of CMR ranged from 0-14 months (mono) and 0-5 months (combo), and at this cut-off the follow-up is insuf/f_icient to assess
CMR duration. High CMR rates were observed in high-risk pts ( Table).
The most common adverse event (AE) was cytokine release syndr ome (CRS): 66% and 79% in the mono and combo cohorts,
respectively. CRS rates by mono cohort were as follows: 2.5/1 0/16mg cohort, 100% (3/3); 2.5/10/30mg cohort, 76% (16/21);

CRS events in the combo cohort and no Gr 4 or 5 CRS with either re gimen. Of pts with CRS, tocilizumab was used to treat
CRS in 22.9% pts in mono cohorts and 33.3% pts in the combo cohort . All CRS events were manageable and had resolved
at data cut-off. Neurologic AEs were seen in 26 pts (16 mono, 10 combo; 36%); all Gr 1 (n =17) or Gr 2 (n =9). No ICANS-like

Abstract Type: Oral Presentation
Session Title: Follicular and mantle cell lymphoma - Role of bispecifics
Background:
Epcoritamab, a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody, led to deep, durable responses in patients 
(
pts
)
 with multiply
R/R FL 
(
overall response rate [ORR] 82%, complete response [CR] rate 63% per independent review
)
 in the
pivotal cohort of EPCORE
™
 NHL
​
1 
(
phase 1/2; NCT03625037
)
. Safety was manageable; most CRS events were
low grade 
(
G; 66% overall; 40% G1, 25% G2, 2% G3
)
, all resolved, and none led to treatment 
(
tx
)
discontinuation. Further mitigation of CRS and ICANS may increase epcoritamab accessibility and reduce
healthcare resource use. Enhanced CRS mitigation strategies and omission of mandatory hospitalization for
CRS monitoring are being investigated in a C1 OPT cohort.
Aims:
To report the largest population of patients 
(
pts
)
 with R/R FL receiving epcoritamab to date, with efficacy
(
including minimal residual disease [MRD]
)
 from the EPCORE NHL
​
1 FL pivotal and C1 OPT cohorts and safety
from the fully enrolled C1 OPT cohort.
Methods:
In the C1 OPT cohort, pts with CD20+ R/R FL G1
–
3A and 
≥
2 prior lines of systemic tx received subcutaneous
epcoritamab in 28-d Cs, including a third step
​
up dose in C1 
(
D1, 0.16 mg; D8, 0.8 mg; D15, 3 mg
)
, followed by
48-mg full doses 
(
QW, C1
–
3; Q2W, C4
–
9; Q4W, C
≥
10
)
 until disease progression. In C1, adequate hydration and
dexamethasone 
(
preferred steroid for mandatory CRS prophylaxis
)
 were recommended. Hospitalization for CRS
monitoring was not mandated. Primary endpoints were rates of any-grade and G
≥
2 CRS events. Secondary
endpoints included response 
(
Lugano
)
, MRD in peripheral blood 
(
clonoSEQ® assay; 10
−
6 cutoff
)
, and
safety/tolerability. A pooled analysis of response per investigator and MRD negativity was conducted.
Results:
As of the data cutoff 
(
Jan 8, 2024; median follow-up, 5.7 mo
)
, 86 pts with R/R FL had received epcoritamab in
this C1 OPT cohort 
(
median of 2 prior tx lines [range, 2
–
9], 92% stage III
–
IV FL, 63% double-refractory disease,
44% primary refractory disease, and 42% POD24
)
. All CRS events were low grade 
(
49% overall; 40% G1, 9% G2
)
,
most occurred during C1, and none led to tx discontinuation. Corresponding with reduced CRS rate and
severity with C1 OPT, IL
​
6 levels 24 h after the first full dose were lower with C1 OPT vs the pivotal cohort. No
ICANS or clinical tumor lysis syndrome occurred. Most pts in C1 OPT who received the first full dose 
(
44/82;
54%
)
 were monitored for CRS as outpatients. Of the 38 pts who were hospitalized, 18 were hospitalized to
monitor for potential CRS and 20 were hospitalized for logistical/social reasons or other AEs. Among the 214
pts in the pivotal and C1 OPT cohorts, which had similar demographics and disease characteristics, ORR was
84% and CR rate was 65% 
(
Figure
)
. In each cohort, median times to response and CR were 1.4 mo and 1.5 mo,
respectively. CR was associated with improved progression-free survival 
(
PFS
)
. Among MRD-evaluable pts in
both cohorts 
(
n=135
)
, MRD negativity was observed in 89 pts 
(
66%
)
, and MRD negativity overall and at C3D1
(
prespecified time point
)
 were associated with improved PFS 
(
Figure
)
. Additional data, including subgroup
analyses, will be presented.
Summary/Conclusion:Epcoritamab monotherapy showed early, deep responses in the largest R/R FL population treated with a
T
​
cell
−
engaging therapy to date. CR and MRD negativity, including at C3D1, were associated with improved
PFS. Safety was manageable in both cohorts, and CRS rate and severity were substantially reduced with C1
OPT, with few G2 and no G
≥
3 events. The data suggest that mandatory hospitalization for CRS monitoring is
not necessary and support further evaluation of outpatient epcoritamab tx for pts with R/R FL.

Abstract Background
Most patients (pts) with r/r FL remain incurable and eventual ly relapse or progress. Previously, a Ph1 study of relma-cel
(NCT03344367) had demonstrated preliminary safety and ef/f_ic acy in r/r B-NHL pts, including those with r/r FL. A Ph2 piv-
otal study in r/r FL pts had been enrolled and preliminary ef/f_i cacy, safety and PK was presented.
Methods

Background: TQ-B3525 is a novel and selective oral PI3K a/dinhibitor. In an earlier Phase I trial,
TQ-B3525 achieved outstanding efficacy in subjects with refractory/relapsed follicular lym-phoma (R/R FL) (2020 ASCO Abstract #8058). Here, we report the result from a single-arm,open-label, phase II registration study evaluating the safety and efficacy of TQ-B3525 in R/R FL
patients. Methods: This phase II study included exploratory stage 1 and confirmatory stage 2.
Patients with R/R FL after $2 lines therapies received oral 20 mg TQ-B3525 once daily in a 28-
day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Primary endpoint was independentreview committee (IRC)-assessed objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints wereORR by investigator assessment; the IRC- and investigator-assessed disease control rate(DCR), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival(PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: Based on results (ORR, 88.0%; DOR,
11.8 months; PFS, 12.0 months) in 25 patients at stage 1, second stage study was initiated
and included 82 patients for efficacy/safety analysis.Patients received a median of 3 prior lines,
with 56.1% refractory to previous therapies; 73.2% experienced POD24 at baseline. At stage 2,ORR was 86.6% (71/82; 95% CI, 77.3%-93.1%), with 28 (34.2%) complete responses. Seven(8.5%) had stable disease for DCR of 95.1%. Median TTR was 1.8 months. Among 71 responders,median DOR was not reached; 18-month DOR rate was 51.6%. At median follow-up of13.3 months, median PFS was 18.5 (95% CI, 10.2-not estimable) months; estimated 24-month OS rate was 86.1%. Response rates and survival data were consistent across all sub-groups. Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 63 (76.8%) patients,
with neutrophil count decreased (22.0%), hyperglycemia (19.5%), and diarrhea (13.4%) being
common. Conclusions: TQ-B3525 exhibited favorable efficacy and manageable safety profiles,
supporting its potential as a valuable treatment modality for heavily pretreated Chinese R/R/ FLpatients. Clinical trial information: NCT04324879.

Yang_2024.pdf,"Myeloma using statistical methods but also allowed us to predict new patients with
missing data. This model was built and tuned using data from multiple myeloma
patients from a public database from a study conducted in Arkansas.
Results: The results of the Bayesian model allowed us to estimate the survival of
patients with missing information. Additionally, when compared with the classic
Cox models in patients with complete data, the performance metrics did not
deteriorate (concordance index of 72% and 71% respectively) in patients withcomplete data. In addition, it allows for estimating survival and staging the risk of
patients with multiple myeloma with missing data, maintaining the concordance
rate at 71%.
Conclusions: A model that performs as well as Cox models in patients with complete
data and maintains this performance in patients with missing data is achieved. It also
allows the prediction of new patients who are diagnosed with multiple myeloma
without the restriction that their complete clinical or genetic data is needed.

Background: Amulirafusp alfa (IMM0306) is a fusion protein of CD20 monoclonal
antibody with the CD47 binding domain of SIRP aon both heavy chains. It exerts
excellent cancer killing effect by activating both macrophages and natural killer cells
via blockade of CD47-SIRP ainteraction and Fc ɣR engagement. Here, we report the
safety and ef ﬁcacy results in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory follicular
lymphoma (R/R FL) from a phase II study (NCT05805943).
Methods: Eligible patients with FL Grade 1-3a received intravenous Amulirafusp alfa
once a week of a 28-day treatment cycle with dose of 2.0 mg/kg until disease pro-
gression or intolerable toxicity. Safety was evaluated per the Common TerminologyCriteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Tumor assessments were performed by
Lugano 2014. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary
endpoints including disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), and
safety.
Results: As of Mar 14, 2024, 16 pts with FL were enrolled. The median age was 61
years old with 10 (62.5%) males. The median prior lines of therapy were 4. All 16 pts
received previous anti-CD20 therapy. The most common treatment related adverse
events (TRAEs) were lymphocyte (LYM) decreased (68.8%), platelet (PLT) decreased(50.0%), white blood cell (WBC) decreased (43.8%), anemia (43.8%) and absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) decreased (31.3%). /C21Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 62.5% of pts.
The most common /C21grade 3 TRAEs were LYM decreased (50.0%), PLT decreased
(18.8%), ANC decreased (18.8%) and pneumonia (18.8%). 18.8% of pts experienced
serious TRAEs, all was pneumonia, in which 2 pts were recovering and 1 pts recoveredwithout sequelae. No adverse event led to drug reduction, discontinuation or death.
Among 15 ef ﬁcacy evaluable pts with R/R FL, the ORR and DCR assessed by inves-
tigator was 33.3% and 66.7%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 5.72 months,
the PFS rate at 9 months was 58.3%.
Conclusions: Amulirafusp alfa (IMM0306) was well-tolerated and presented robust
preliminary anti-tumor activity in pts with R/R FL. This phase II study is ongoing.

Background: Targeted therapy with Bruton ’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis)
become the standard of care for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Orelabrutinib (O)
is a novel BTKi with high selectivity and a favorable safety pro ﬁle. Despite substantial
bene ﬁts in CLL with O, real-world data remains scarce. This study aimed to evaluate
the ef ﬁcacy of O-based regimens for CLL with comorbidities in a real-world setting.
Methods: Data were retrospectively reviewed for 15 pts with CLL who underwent O-
based regimens from Jun. 10, 2022, to Sep. 10, 2023. The outcome was the hema-
tologic response (HR) rate, de ﬁned as the proportion of pts with abnormal baseline
hematologic parameters who had a hemoglobin (Hb) response, platelet (Plt)response, or lymphocyte (Lym) response (Hb/Plt/Lym count return to or reduce
>50% from baseline).
Results: Baseline characteristics of the pts are presented in the table. The median
duration of O therapy was 10.7 months (interquartile range [IQR], 8.6-14.9). At the
data cut-off (Apr. 26, 2024; median follow-up, 12.7 months), 14 (93.3%) pts achieved
an HR. The remaining 1 pt that did not reach HR was a third-line treatment pt with
HBV infection, and there was some recovery of hematologic indexes. Regarding
different O-based regimens, HR was achieved in 100% (8/8) of pts receiving O
monotherapy and 85.7% (6/7) receiving O + chemotherapy. No serious adverse events
occurred in the pts with comorbidities.
